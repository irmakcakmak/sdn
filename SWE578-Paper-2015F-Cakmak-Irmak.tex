\usepackage{multirow}
\usepackage{graphicx}

% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)



% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % The IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage{acronym}
% acronym.sty was written by Tobias Oetiker. This package provides tools for
% managing documents with large numbers of acronyms. (You don't *have* to
% use this package - unless you have a lot of acronyms, you may feel that
% such package management of them is bit of an overkill.)
% Do note that the acronym environment (which lists acronyms) will have a
% problem when used under IEEEtran.cls because acronym.sty relies on the
% description list environment - which IEEEtran.cls has customized for
% producing IEEE style lists. A workaround is to declared the longest
% label width via the IEEEtran.cls \IEEEiedlistdecl global control:
%
% \renewcommand{\IEEEiedlistdecl}{\IEEEsetlabelwidth{SONET}}
% \begin{acronym}
%
% \end{acronym}
% \renewcommand{\IEEEiedlistdecl}{\relax}% remember to reset \IEEEiedlistdecl
%
% instead of using the acronym environment's optional argument.
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/acronym


%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/mdwtools


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/eqparbox




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.


% NOTE: PDF thumbnail features are not required in IEEE papers
%       and their use requires extra complexity and work.
%\ifCLASSINFOpdf
%  \usepackage[pdftex]{thumbpdf}
%\else
%  \usepackage[dvips]{thumbpdf}
%\fi
% thumbpdf.sty and its companion Perl utility were written by Heiko Oberdiek.
% It allows the user a way to produce PDF documents that contain fancy
% thumbnail images of each of the pages (which tools like acrobat reader can
% utilize). This is possible even when using dvi->ps->pdf workflow if the
% correct thumbpdf driver options are used. thumbpdf.sty incorporates the
% file containing the PDF thumbnail information (filename.tpm is used with
% dvips, filename.tpt is used with pdftex, where filename is the base name of
% your tex document) into the final ps or pdf output document. An external
% utility, the thumbpdf *Perl script* is needed to make these .tpm or .tpt
% thumbnail files from a .ps or .pdf version of the document (which obviously
% does not yet contain pdf thumbnails). Thus, one does a:
% 
% thumbpdf filename.pdf 
%
% to make a filename.tpt, and:
%
% thumbpdf --mode dvips filename.ps
%
% to make a filename.tpm which will then be loaded into the document by
% thumbpdf.sty the NEXT time the document is compiled (by pdflatex or
% latex->dvips->ps2pdf). Users must be careful to regenerate the .tpt and/or
% .tpm files if the main document changes and then to recompile the
% document to incorporate the revised thumbnails to ensure that thumbnails
% match the actual pages. It is easy to forget to do this!
% 
% Unix systems come with a Perl interpreter. However, MS Windows users
% will usually have to install a Perl interpreter so that the thumbpdf
% script can be run. The Ghostscript PS/PDF interpreter is also required.
% See the thumbpdf docs for details. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at.
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/thumbpdf


% NOTE: PDF hyperlink and bookmark features are not required in IEEE
%       papers and their use requires extra complexity and work.
% *** IF USING HYPERREF BE SURE AND CHANGE THE EXAMPLE PDF ***

%\usepackage[\MYhyperrefoptions,breaklinks=true,dvips]{hyperref}
%\usepackage{breakurl}
%\fi
% One significant drawback of using hyperref under DVI output is that the
% LaTeX compiler cannot break URLs across lines or pages as can be done
% under pdfLaTeX's PDF output via the hyperref pdftex driver. This is
% probably the single most important capability distinction between the
% DVI and PDF output. Perhaps surprisingly, all the other PDF features
% (PDF bookmarks, thumbnails, etc.) can be preserved in
% .tex->.dvi->.ps->.pdf workflow if the respective packages/scripts are
% loaded/invoked with the correct driver options (dvips, etc.). 
% As most IEEE papers use URLs sparingly (mainly in the references), this
% may not be as big an issue as with other publications.
%
% That said, Vilar Camara Neto created his breakurl.sty package which
% permits hyperref to easily break URLs even in dvi mode.
% Note that breakurl, unlike most other packages, must be loaded
% AFTER hyperref. The latest version of breakurl and its documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/breakurl
% breakurl.sty is not for use under pdflatex pdf mode.
%
% The advanced features offer by hyperref.sty are not required for IEEE
% submission, so users should weigh these features against the added
% complexity of use.
% The package options above demonstrate how to enable PDF bookmarks
% (a type of table of contents viewable in Acrobat Reader) as well as
% PDF document information (title, subject, author and keywords) that is
% viewable in Acrobat reader's Document_Properties menu. PDF document
% information is also used extensively to automate the cataloging of PDF
% documents. The above set of options ensures that hyperlinks will not be
% colored in the text and thus will not be visible in the printed page,
% but will be active on "mouse over". USING COLORS OR OTHER HIGHLIGHTING
% OF HYPERLINKS CAN RESULT IN DOCUMENT REJECTION BY THE IEEE, especially if
% these appear on the "printed" page. IF IN DOUBT, ASK THE RELEVANT
% SUBMISSION EDITOR. You may need to add the option hypertexnames=false if
% you used duplicate equation numbers, etc., but this should not be needed
% in normal IEEE work.
% The latest version of hyperref and its documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/hyperref





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.

\begin{abstract}
Software defined networking is a design model, set of principles, and an abstraction rather than a new technology. By defining right abstractions, this approach makes network design, implementation, operation, debugging, and troubleshooting easier. Also by providing layering, it makes innovation in network technologies easier and more cost effective. This short paper tries to describe how and whys of these claims shortly, from the perspective of the author.

\IEEEPARstart{C}{urrent} IP based network technologies have three abstractions: data plane, control plane, and management plane. Data plane's responsibility is described by simply forwarding of packets through switches or routers. In case of a switch forwarding, network device simply checks the header of the packet and then forwards the packet to its destination via its MAC address. Routers do the same job through IP address based forwarding. This process is simple as no state computation is done. On the contrary, control plane computes the next forwarding state, which means whether the packet will be forwarded, dropped or rerouted to another destination than its intended target. Example mechanisms for control plane are firewalls, distributed routing algorithms, ACLs, VLANs, MPLS, etc. Management plane carries administration traffic. Commands like telnet, ping, traceroute, etc. are trafficked through this plane. Generally management plane is considered within the control plane. The argument of SDN is data plane has a very well abstraction and theoretical base; yet, control plane is a bag of protocols lacking any abstraction, layering or theoretical background which hinders innovation in control plane and in general, networking. TCP/IP technology, for instance, has very good abstractions as seven layers. These layers are developed further based on the theory behind it, without affecting other layers, and without needing to rethink every aspect of the protocol. On the other side, if a researcher is designing a new algorithm for routing, she needs to start from scratch. SDN argues, providing right abstractions for control plane will make it open to innovation and development, similar to data plane.

\section{SDN}
In current networking architectures, both control plane and data plane are generally 
bundled together in network switches. When a new device is added to the network 
or a policy is changed, operator needs to configure each device individually. 
Also, there exist a lot of middle-boxes, such as firewalls or packet inspectors, 
which also enforce control policies to the network. These also require individual 
administration and configuration. This situation makes management of large 
networks very hard, error prone, difficult to troubleshoot. As stated before, 
SDN argues, control plane needs better abstractions. What are these 
abstractions? First control plane needs to discover the network topology 
to achieve its goals. Then, it needs to find out how it can enforce its 
goal (firewall isolation, trafficking, routing) on that topology. 
Finally, it needs to describe switches and routers how to forward. To 
be able to achieve these goals, SDN provides two abstractions: 
network discovery and network switch configuration.

Network discovery is done by network operating system. It runs on commodity 
hardware servers within the network and communicates with switches through 
a forwarding model. It is aware of the network topology through a 
virtualized network abstraction (network virtualization). NOS 
configures network switches for forwarding through southbound APIs 
(One of the API providers is OpenFlow and it will be described 
in the next section). Operator programs the network using a control 
program. Simply, operator writes her function and control 
program executes the function against the network topology, using 
network operating system’s APIs. The abstraction provided here is 
that control program does not concern itself with the whereabouts of 
the network topology. It is provided by the operating system. 
On the other side, OS does not concern itself with the goal of 
the operator. It provides the network topology and conveys the control 
program’s forwarding information down to the switches. 
This clean separation of concerns allows innovation in different 
layers keeping them intact. 



\section{Main Components of an SDN~Architecture}

\subsubsection{Infrastructure}
Network infrastructure is typically composed of switches, routers, and various middle-boxes.
Generally all these devices are more intelligent than they need to be. They decide what
packet to forward and what not to, meaning that assuming the role of control plane elements.
In an SDN network architecture, as mentioned before, simple data forwarding operation and 
deciding what to forward are seperated. In other words, intelligence is removed from data 
plane and given to a centralized control system, generally called, network operating system 
(hereafter, NOS). As a consequence, what is left for infrastructure elements are simple 
packet forwarding job. Yet, control programs need to be able to program those devices, 
and this is typically done by using a common protocol (e.g. OpenFlow), providing 
programmability of different devices, along with interoperability of such devices 
in a heterogeneous networking environment.

Programming APIs, mediating communication between forwarding and control elements
are called Southbound interfaces.
Simply, it sits between the NOS and hardware in the architecture. Topology changes,
 flow statistics, and alien packets seen first time by switches are provided to 
NOS by southbound interfaces.

OpenFlow is such a protocol  for programming
 switches and routers exploiting common denominator of device interfaces exposed.
It provides set of methods for programming flow-table of devices.
An OpenFlow switch has three pieces: flow table, secure channel, 
and OpenFlow protocol. Flow table keeps the flow entries, which holds the actions 
for telling a device how to process the flow. Secure channel is the communication 
path between the device and the control program, through which commands and packets are 
transferred. Lastly, OpenFlow protocol supplies the means of communication between 
the control program and the device.

Definition of flow is generally dependent on the context. In one network environment it 
can be defined as all packets from a specific IP or MAC address, yet in another 
context it can be defined as all packets originating from the same port of a router. 
In more general sense, it can be defined as a group of packets meeting a certain criteria.

Flow table entries have three fields: definition header, action, and statistics. 
Fields of a definition header can be seen in table one. Actions defines the way to 
process matching packets. Basic examples for actions are "forward matching packets to 
specific ports", "make controller program receive this flow's packets", and 
"drop packets belonging to a flow". Statistics fields keeps basic accounting of flows. 
These stats include the number of packets matching each flow and the timestamp of 
the last matched packet to a flow.

 &  & SA & DA & Type & SA & DA & Proto & Src & Dst \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\end{table}


\subsubsection{Network Operating System}
Network operating systems exist for quite some time, but they all have been specific
 to certain vendors and closed source. Also they have been more like a collection 
of instructions (Juniper JunOS, Cisco IOS).

On the other hand, NOSs in SDN nomenclature, have wider responsibilities and capabilities.
 They sit between the southbound interface and network control applications.
 Their goals are similar to traditional OS, but in a networking 
level. NOSs provide two basic novelties: first, applications on top of NOS can 
be programmed using a centralized programming model, viewing the whole network as 
a single machine; second, they can be programmed using higher level
abstractions (host names, user names) instead of low-level primitives (MAC address).
 A network programmer does not need to know how to interface with any forwarding 
device.

NOS views network in switch level along with middle-boxes, users, offered services.
 It only lacks current state of network traffic. NOS gathers this view using 
the aforementioned flows provided through southbound interfaces. In detail, when a
 flow in a switch does not match any entry in the table, it is forwarded 
to the control program (NOS). Alternatively, flow-table might have been programmed 
to forward packets belonging to particular protocols, such as DNS, to NOS. Using 
these flows NOS gathers the network view and decides to forward the traffic or not
 and calculates the route.

 NOX, Floodlight, Maestro, Beacon, ProgrammableFlow, Ryu NOS, Rosemary are some 
examples of such control progragrams, addressing different needs and having 
different purposes. All are considered as network operating systems.

Programming APIs provided by a NOS are generally called "Northbound interface"s.
 Their goal are similar to what POSIX tries to achieve for UNIX, providing a 
standard way of programming to OS programmers. These APIs are RESTful in some 
instances. On some others, they are provided as programming languages or file 
systems.

Also network operating systems which have distributed nature, expose east and 
westbound interfaces providing functions for data communication among 
cntroller instances, applying data consistency algorithms, and controller node 
monitoring.

\subsubsection{Applications}
 Network applications are the actual entites managing the network. Proposed 
layering up until now is solely aimed at providing right abstractions for 
applications. Forwarding behaviour of the network is programmed in application 
level against the virtual network topology provided by network operating system,
 network virtualization, and higher level programming languages. Defined behaviour 
is installed to switches by NOS through southbound API.

Network applications are developed and deployed for executing 
certain network functions such as, 
enforcing security policies, routing, network virtualization, load balancing,
 power saving, providing reliability, measurement and monitoring,
 traffic engineering and optimization, etc.

One of the most promising novelites provided by this capability in 
networking is SDN app stores. HP hosts an app store similar to Apple or
 Google's stores for mobile devices. Store provides apps for OpenFlow
 based HP devices.
